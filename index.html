        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
            <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am a Certified Salesforce Developer with over 8 years of IT experience, specializing in Salesforce configuration, customization, and maintenance. My expertise spans across Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Salesforce Einstein, where I have successfully implemented AI-driven automation, predictive analytics, and scalable cloud solutions to enhance business operations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
            <p>I have a strong background in Salesforce development, including Lightning Web Components (LWC), Apex, Visualforce, SOQL, REST & SOAP API integrations, and automation tools like Process Builder, Workflows, and Flows. I am also skilled in third-party integrations, security enhancements, and scalable application design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
            <p>Beyond traditional CRM solutions, I have expanded my expertise into AWS Generative AI technologies, incorporating services such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q, SageMaker, S3 Buckets, API Gateway, and AWS Lambda. These technologies allow me to build and deploy custom Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating complex tasks, improving customer interactions, and enhancing business decision-making. My work involves developing AI-driven chatbots that assist in solving technical challenges, predictive data analysis, and workflow automation. By integrating AWS AI services into Salesforce and other enterprise applications, I help organizations leverage the power of AI for intelligent decision-making and operational efficiency. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
            <p>In addition to my Salesforce expertise, I have a strong background in Java development. Early in my career, I worked as a Java Developer, where I designed and developed enterprise applications using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and RESTful web services. My experience includes building scalable, secure, and high-performance backend solutions, integrating databases using JDBC and JPA, and working with microservices architecture. I have also developed automation scripts, API-driven applications, and data processing pipelines using Java, enhancing business efficiency and data integrity. This foundation in Java programming has significantly contributed to my ability to write efficient Apex code and optimize Salesforce development processes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
            <p>Beyond my technical skills, I am an advocate of Agile methodologies, ensuring streamlined workflows, automated testing, and continuous integration for faster development cycles. My experience also includes mentoring teams, collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders, and optimizing Salesforce environments for enterprise-scale applications. I am always eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to cutting-edge Salesforce projects that push the boundaries of cloud technology.</p>
